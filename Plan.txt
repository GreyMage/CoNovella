			when the author changes, the list should move to center the new one.
		The URL should change to one that can be read by the system to jump directly to the story, for sharing. 
		The story should auto-scroll as it's written and fade out as it reaches the top of the screen.
			Viewing the full story should be possible via scrolling(?) or clicking a "Read Full Story" button.
