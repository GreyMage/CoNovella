Main page: 
	Welcome flyout appears if first visit
	Get list of top 5 most recently updated stories, keep them updating
		with socket events, do not change this list without user action.
		i.e., do no add new stories to the list, just show the most recent 5 
		at time of load, and keep them updated live.
	The list should show stats like: Words per turn, number of authors, Title, total words, etc.
	Clicking a Story lets you watch the story being written, and shows most of the details.
		Synopis, who's turn it is, spectators, and so on.
		The authors should appear from the right as a list, centered on the current author. 
			when the author changes, the list should move to center the new one.
		The URL should change to one that can be read by the system to jump directly to the story, for sharing. 
		The story should auto-scroll as it's written and fade out as it reaches the top of the screen.
			Viewing the full story should be possible via scrolling(?) or clicking a "Read Full Story" button.
			
Good g-fonts for the stories:
